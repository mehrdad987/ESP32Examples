## 1..Improved Interrupt Handling: ##

The code now uses a single interrupt handler function < handleInterrupt() > that is marked as IRAM_ATTR to ensure fast execution. The interrupt is attached to the rising edge of the interrupt pin.

## 2..Timer Initialization: ##

The timer is initialized using timerBegin() and timerAttachInterrupt(), with the timer divider set to 80 to get a timer counter frequency of 1 MHz. The timerAlarmEnable() function is used to enable the timer interrupts.

## 3..Critical Section Management: ##

The code uses a single mutex timerMux to protect the shared variables interruptTime and frequency from race conditions in the interrupt handler and the main loop.

## 4..Frequency Calculation: ##

The frequency is calculated directly from the timer counter value, using the timerRead() function to get the current time and the TIMER_SCALE constant to convert the timer counter value to seconds.

## 5..RPM Calculation: ##

The RPM is calculated using the formula 30.0 * frequency * Co_F, where Co_F is a constant.

## 6..Noise Filtering: ##

The code applies a simple noise filter by setting the RPM to 0 if it exceeds 10,000.
